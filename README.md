# Parallel Computing Course Projects

This repository contains programming assignments and projects for a parallel computing course. The implementations focus on various parallel computing concepts and algorithms.

## Project Structure

- **Odd-Even Sort**: Implementation of parallel odd-even sort algorithm
- **Mandelbrot Set**: Parallel computation of Mandelbrot set
- **All-Pairs Shortest Path**: Parallel implementation of all-pairs shortest path algorithm
- **FlashAttention**: Implementation of flash attention mechanism

Each project directory contains:
- Source code files (.cc/.cu)
- Project report (report.md)
- Assignment specification (PP_2024_*.pdf)
